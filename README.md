This project explores alpha beta pruning for a connect 4 bot. As of currently it works well enough that I have not won against it. 
Although, I believe it is possible to win because when the bot plays against itself it does not play a perfect game (the second bot 
always falls for a fork). <br> <br>

For future projects consider methods to reduce recalculations.
